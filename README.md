# React + Redux Research

This app demonstrated React, Redux, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), Webpack, Immutable.js, and the Redux Dev Tools.

To get started:

```bash
npm i
node server.js
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000/#/giphy` for an example of async fetching.

Use `ctrl+H` to toggle the dev tools and check out `src/index.js` to try out different dev tool monitors. 

# To Do

- better router without the `/#/`
- wrap up errors
- styleguide -- all states
- build distribution files
- run tests
